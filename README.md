# WannaBe  
## Intelligent Career Transition Recommender

WannaBe is an intelligent decision-support system designed to transform noisy, unstructured career histories into actionable, data-driven professional roadmaps. By combining semantic role resolution, probabilistic graph modeling, large-scale skill extraction, and grounded LLM narration, WannaBe provides users with a clear and statistically validated path from their current role to their ultimate career goal.

---

## Overview

### The Problem

Traditional career platforms focus on job listings or static employment histories. They lack tools for planning multi-step career transitions. Users often know their destination role but struggle to identify the intermediate career "hops" and the specific technical DNA required to reach it.

### The Solution

WannaBe constructs a Directed Transition Graph from thousands of historical job sequences. It resolves informal job titles into canonical professional roles using high-performance semantic vector search and computes the most efficient transition path between them.

Each transition step is enriched with:
- Role-defining skills identified via Big Data processing.
- Transition probabilities based on historical career moves.
- Strategic explanations grounded in real-world professional data.

## Intelligent Design and Theoretical Foundation

WannaBe’s architecture is grounded in four major research pillars that justify its algorithmic design.

### 1. Relational Mobility (Shalaby et al., 2018)

Career mobility is modeled as a directed graph of job-to-job transitions. This relational structure allows the system to calculate transition probabilities and handle semantic rigidity through neural embeddings (Deep Learning Matchers), providing a scalable alternative to traditional keyword matching.

### 2. Skill-Centric Standardization (Gugnani et al., 2018)

Skills, rather than inconsistent job titles, are treated as the fundamental units of career progression. This theory ensures cross-organizational stability, allowing the system to bridge the gap between roles with different titles but identical technical requirements.

### 3. Path Planning Optimization (Ghosh et al., 2020)

Career progression is framed as a computational path planning problem. The system treats a career goal as a destination in a latent skill space and searches for the optimal sequence of intermediate "hops" to maximize the likelihood of reaching that goal.

### 4. Asymmetric Transition Difficulty (Dawson et al., 2021)

The system recognizes that transitions are directional and asymmetric. Moving from "Senior to Junior" is mathematically different from "Junior to Senior." We incorporate Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) logic to identify core competencies and ensure roadmaps reflect realistic labor market constraints.

## System Architecture

### Semantic Role Resolution

To handle vocabulary mismatch in job titles, WannaBe uses Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode job roles into 384-dimensional embeddings. A FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index enables near-instant mapping of free-text user input to our canonical professional roles.

---

### Graph-Based Pathfinding

Career transitions are represented as edges in a directed graph, weighted by empirical probabilities.

Algorithm:  
Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to compute the shortest path (highest probability).

Cost Function:

Weight = -ln(P) + γ


Where:
- P is the transition probability.
- γ (set to 1.0) is a regularization hyperparameter that balances statistical realism with path efficiency, preventing overly long or weak roadmaps.

## Automated Skill Extraction Pipeline (Big Data Processing)

The Skill Extractor is a PySpark-based pipeline responsible for identifying the "technical DNA" of every role. This ensures advice is grounded in market requirements rather than generic descriptions.

### Mechanism

- NLP Pre-processing:  
  Standardizes titles and descriptions using Spark NLP, removing noise and non-informative text.

- Pattern-Based Extraction:  
  Uses complex Regex and tokenization to identify technical competencies, tools, and methodologies.

- Statistical Frequency Filtering:  
  Implements the RCA principle by calculating skill frequency within job clusters. Only skills appearing above a specific threshold (e.g., the top 10 most frequent) are promoted to the final role_skills_list.csv.

---

## Hybrid Strategic Narration

WannaBe addresses the "Interpretability Gap" identified in prior research (Ghosh et al., 2020) by combining deterministic data retrieval with generative narration. Unlike "black-box" systems, the AI Coach does not hallucinate career advice; it acts as a narrative interface for the statistical data calculated by the system's core engines.

### Narrative Orchestration Algorithms

- Deterministic Path Retrieval:  
  The narrative layer first ingests the specific sequence of canonical roles generated by the Dijkstra Search and the corresponding Transition Probabilities $(-\ln(P) + \gamma)$.

- RCA-Grounded Metadata Enrichment:  
  For each transition "hop," the system queries the role_skills_list.csv to retrieve the top technical competencies. These skills are pre-validated via Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) logic, ensuring the explanation focuses on role-defining skills rather than generic requirements.

- Automated Skill-Gap Mapping:  
  For every step in the roadmap, the system performs a set-difference operation between the "Source Role Skills" and the "Target Role Skills." This algorithmically identifies the exact Skill Delta the user needs to bridge.

- Constrained LLM Grounding:  
  The identified path, skill-gaps, and transition weights are passed to the LLM (Gemini) through a strictly constrained prompt. By grounding the LLM in pre-computed CSV and Graph metadata, the system ensures that the "AI Coach" remains transparent, trustworthy, and entirely data-driven.

## Academic Foundation

WannaBe is theoretically grounded in four seminal research papers that provide the mathematical and structural logic for our career transition algorithms.

---

### 1. Relational Mobility and Deep Learning Matchers

**Shalaby et al. (2018):**  
*Help Me Find a Job: A Graph-based Approach for Job Recommendation at Scale.*

**Project Application:**  
Provides the rationale for modeling professional mobility as a homogeneous directed graph of roles rather than a user-centric model.

**Specific Algorithm:**  
Justifies the use of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to compute asymmetric transition probabilities and implements the Deep Learning Matcher (DLM) theory via Sentence-BERT to resolve semantic ambiguity and the "cold-start" problem in job titles.

---

### 2. Skill-Centric Standardization

**Gugnani et al. (2018):**  
*Generating Unified Candidate Skill Graph for Career Path Recommendation.*

**Project Application:**  
Establishes the theory that skills, not job titles, are the "unified building blocks" of career mobility.

**Specific Algorithm:**  
Informs our Skill Extraction Pipeline, which treats skills as first-class entities to solve the "Title Inflation" problem, where identical technical roles carry different names across different organizations.

---

### 3. Career Pathing as an Optimization Problem

**Ghosh et al. (2020):**  
*Skill-based Career Path Modeling and Recommendation.*

**Project Application:**  
Formulates career progression as a Computational Path Planning Problem toward a long-term goal rather than a single-hop recommendation.

**Specific Algorithm:**  
Grounded our choice of Dijkstra’s Algorithm and our cost function:

Weight = -ln(P) + γ


as a deterministic method to identify the most feasible sequence of intermediate milestones. It also highlights the need for actionable feedback, which we address via our Narrative LLM layer.

---

### 4. Asymmetric Transitions and Skill Importance (RCA)

**Dawson et al. (2021):**  
*Skill-driven Recommendations for Job Transition Pathways.*

**Project Application:**  
Establishes that professional transitions are directional and asymmetric, for example, the difficulty of moving from Junior to Senior is mathematically distinct from the reverse.

**Specific Algorithm:**  
Justifies our Statistical Frequency Filtering through the principle of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), ensuring that our system isolates unique "role-defining" skills rather than ubiquitous, non-informative generalities.
