(We can be flexible about starting a little later than 8:00am if that would be better for the candidate’s lifestyle.) This position would work well for a stay-at-home mom/dad, as it is fully remote and part-time. All Steel prioritizes a good home life for our employees.

At All Steel, we want to hire good talent for our company, and so we are posting this job at a starting wage that is approximately 30% higher than the national average for administrative assistants. REQUIRED SKILLS Some basic knowledge of spreadsheets would be helpful, although not strictly essential. The most important requirements are friendliness, trustworthiness, and good WiFi at home. WHO SHOULD NOT APPLY FOR THIS JOB Please do not apply for this position if you want to manage teams of people or do highly interesting work. Although the work you will do is important for our company, it is repetitive and does not involve much collaboration with others. We understand that some people may find this type of work boring, so we want to be candid on our job posting about the position’s requirements. (On the positive side of things: the high starting wage and fully remote setup will hopefully compensate for some of the position’s tedium.)

Please submit the writing sample as a PDF document. NOTA BENE Please do not call our office or email the company directly. We will review all applications through Indeed.
